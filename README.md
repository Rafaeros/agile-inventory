# Material Data Scraper and Viewer

This project consists of two main applications designed to scrape material data from a supplier's website and display it through a web interface.

1.  **Material FastAPI (Python)**: A web scraping service that extracts material data and saves it to a PostgreSQL database.
2.  **Material Spring Boot (Java)**: A web application that retrieves the data from the PostgreSQL database and displays it to the user using JSP pages.

## üèõÔ∏è Project Architecture

The architecture is straightforward: the Python scraper acts as the data producer, and the Java web application acts as the data consumer, with PostgreSQL serving as the central data store.

1.  The **FastAPI** application is triggered to scrape a target website using `BeautifulSoup` and `Requests`.
2.  The scraped data is then cleaned and stored in a **PostgreSQL** database.
3.  The **Spring Boot** application connects to the same PostgreSQL database using **JDBC**.
4.  It serves dynamic web pages using **JSP** to display the material data stored in the database.
